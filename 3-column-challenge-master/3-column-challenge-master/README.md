## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned and practiced about HTML and mostly about CSS Flexbox. Also, the use of variables on CSS is really helpful during the process of styling a page.

### Continued development

I want to keep my focus on web development and explore/train more about CSS.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Flexbox](https://origamid.com/projetos/flexbox-guia-completo/) - This helped me for CSS Flexbox. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Visual Guide to CSS3 Flexbox](https://coding.imweb.io/demo/flex/index.html) - This is an amazing site which helped me seeing the properties of CSS flexbox and how it would look like.
